# hugo Resume

Created from [Start Bootstrap - Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/).

This is basically a single-page website with auto-scrolling based on left-hand nav.  Dedicated project/publications pages allow more detail.  Includes a client-side search powered by fuse.js at '/search' but currently theme does not link to that anywhere.

## Setup & Use

This theme uses a combination of a custom archetype `projects` and some data files to drive content.

You can test the provided [exampleSite](exampleSite) after cloning with the command:
`cd exampleSite;hugo -t hugo-resume --themesDir ../.. server`

### Summary
Edit the main `contents/_index.md with a brief bio/summary`

### Data files
Data files are used for simple content presented on the homepage.

- [data/skills.json](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/blob/master/exampleSite/data/skills.json)
- [data/experience.json](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/blob/master/exampleSite/data/experience.json)
- [data/education.json](https://github.com/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/blob/master/exampleSite/data/education.json)

### Projects
Initially projects were in their own JSON file too, but I decided I wanted to allow more detail and custom formatting.
Projects are added to one of 2 subfolders of `creations` or `contributions`. The difference indicates your role as originator or colaborator.   Use `hugo add projects/TYPE/name-of-project.md` to leverage the proper archetype.

### Publications
Similar to projects, creste them under `publications`. INclude any papers, speaking engagemnents, articles, etc.

### Template params
