Insure++ automatically detects errors in your code, regardless of whether you know they exist. Insure++ identifies compile-time, runtime and algorithmic errors, including memory corruption, operations on uninitialized, NULL, or "wild" pointers, memory leaks, errors that allocate and free dynamic memory, operations on unrelated pointers, and more. Insure++ includes a graphical "Malloc Monitor" that helps developers understand how their programs manipulate memory and a total coverage analysis tool that provides information about which pieces of the code have been tested to insure that all of the program is bug-free, not just the most frequently used parts. </dd><dt>**Platforms** </dt><dd>SunOS, HP, IBM RS6000, SGI 5.X, Digital UNIX, Lynx, Linux, SCO </dd></dl>

[http://www.soft.com/TestWorks/](http://www.soft.com/TestWorks/) </dd><dt>**Software Description** </dt><dd>TCAT C/C++ coverage analysis tool, part of the TestWorks/Coverage suite, uses a new consolidated C and C++ instrumentor to measure logical path and branch completeness at the individual function level (C1) and at the system level (S1). This new compiler-based technology combines the functionality of previous releases of TCAT and S-TCAT.

TCAT C/C++ measures the number of times logical branches have been exercised for both True and False conditions using its C1 metric. The S1 measurement expresses test effectiveness as the percentage of function-calls exercised in a program by a set of tests, relative to the number of such function-calls in the system. 

 TCAT C/C++ instruments the program, placing markers at each logical branch and function-call. When test cases have been run against the instrumented code, the C1 and S1 metrics collect data on the markers and store it in a trace file, from which TCAT C/C++ extracts information to create tabular coverage reports that show which code remains untested or frequently tested, and which test cases duplicate coverage. TCAT C/C++ also creates an archive file that stores all cumulative test information.

[http://www.dynamic-memory.com/](http://www.dynamic-memory.com/) </dd><dt>**Software Description** </dt><dd>Dynamic Code Coverage re-invents the test coverage tool.

 Dynamic Code Coverage does not require any compile/link time instrumentation. Through an innovative strategy, runtime instrumentation is used to gather coverage information. 

 Each function/method, line, decision and branch is evaluated for execution. As the process runs, a detailed coverage file is accumulated. Coverage files from multiple runs can be assembled together. The result is a detailed Coverage Analysis of a particular process. 

 With Dynamic Code Coverage information can be gathered at any point in the software lifecycle. In development, Dynamic Code Coverage can be used for unit testing. In testing, Dynamic Code Coverage can be used to determine test suite effectiveness. In pre-production, Dynamic Code Coverage can determine which modules are of most interest to a particular customer. In production, Dynamic Code Coverage can be used to determine which features and modules are actually being used. 

 With this wealth of information, an incremental, iterative strategy can be developed to make sure all of the software is tested before it makes it to your customers. 

The output can be summarized in a variety of ways in order get different views on the depth of coverage. Each source file can be annotated with function, line, decision and branch information.

The instrumented program keeps track of the code instructions that were executed while the program was running and produces an execution report (csexe file) upon program termination.

Principally, it inserts instrumentation instructions into the preprocessed source code and calls up the native compiler. (GCC, Borland C, Microsoft Visual C compiler,...) A database (.csmes file), which contains the list of instrumentations and a copy of the instrumented source code, is generated at the same time. CoverageScanner is configurable via a profile and can be adapted to most compilers present on the market.
